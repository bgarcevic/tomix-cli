# Error Codes Reference

This document lists every diagnostic code emitted by `tx`, grouped by prefix.
Codes are part of the public API surface — renaming or removing a code requires
a major version bump (see [cli-ux-guidelines.md](cli-ux-guidelines.md#versioning-policy)).

## JSON Error Envelope

Under `--output-format json` (or `--error-format json`), errors are emitted on **stderr**
as a single JSON object using the first Error/Fatal diagnostic:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message describing what happened.",
  "code": "TOMIX_MUTATION_FAILED",
  "severity": "Error",
  "hint": "Optional guidance on how to fix the problem."
}
```

Fields:

| Field      | Type   | Description                                              |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `error`    | string | The diagnostic message. Always present.                  |
| `code`     | string | The diagnostic code (see tables below). Always present.  |
| `severity` | string | `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, or `Fatal`.                  |
| `hint`     | string | Optional fix suggestion. May be `null`.                  |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | Success. |
| 1    | General failure (most errors). |
| 2    | Usage/argument error, IO failure, or pre-condition violation. |

Handlers override the default via `TomixResult.Fail(..., exitCode: 2)`. If no exit code
is specified, the default is `1`. Command-line parse errors (unknown option, missing
required argument, invalid option value) also exit `2`.

## Naming Convention

All diagnostic codes use uppercase `SNAKE_CASE` prefixed with `TOMIX_`. For example:
`TOMIX_MUTATION_SAVE_FAILED`, `TOMIX_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`.

## Mutation Codes (`TOMIX_MUTATION_*`)

Emitted by `MutationRunner` and handlers that participate in the mutation lifecycle
(`add`, `rm`, `set`, `mv`, `replace`, `format`, `script`, `bpa run --fix`,
`bpa rules ignore/unignore`).

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_MUTATION_UNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER` | 1 | The model provider does not implement `IModelMutationSession`. |
| `TOMIX_MUTATION_UNSUPPORTED` | 1 | A `NotSupportedException` was thrown during mutation. |
| `TOMIX_ADD_OPTION_UNSUPPORTED` | 1 | An `add` option was supplied for an object type that cannot consume it (e.g. `--columns` on a CalcGroup). |
| `TOMIX_RENAME_BREAKS_REFS` | 1 | `--strict-refs` was set and the rename (`set -q name`, `mv`) would leave DAX expressions referencing the old name. By default renames rewrite referencing DAX automatically, so this only fires for references that cannot be rewritten (role RLS filters) — or, under `--no-fix-refs`, for any reference. Without `--strict-refs` the rename proceeds with a warning listing the objects left broken. |
| `TOMIX_RM_BREAKS_REFS` | 1 | The object being removed (`rm`) is still referenced by DAX expressions. Unlike a rename there is nothing to rewrite, so the removal is blocked and the message lists the referencing objects; `--force` removes anyway and reports the now-broken references. Structural references (relationships, sort-by, hierarchy levels, perspective and translation entries, role permissions) never block — they are cascade-removed with the object. |
| `TOMIX_MUTATION_INVALID_VALUE` | 1 | An `ArgumentException` was thrown — invalid argument value. |
| `TOMIX_MUTATION_FAILED` | 1 | An `InvalidOperationException` was thrown — generic mutation failure. |
| `TOMIX_MUTATION_SAVE_FAILED` | 2 | An `IOException` occurred while saving the model. |

## Object Lookup Codes (`TOMIX_OBJECT_*`)

Emitted by `get`, `deps`, and `format -p` when a model object path fails to resolve.

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` | 1 | The object path matched zero objects. Includes a hint. |
| `TOMIX_OBJECT_AMBIGUOUS` | 1 | The object path matched more than one object. |

## BPA Codes (`TOMIX_BPA_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_BPA_INVALID_FAIL_ON` | 2 | Invalid `--fail-on` value (expected: error, warning). |
| `TOMIX_BPA_RULE_ID_REQUIRED` | 2 | `bpa rules ignore/unignore` called without a rule id. |
| `TOMIX_BPA_RULES_LOAD_FAILED` | 2 | Failed to load the BPA rules catalog. |
| `TOMIX_BPA_VIOLATIONS` | 1 | BPA gate blocked the operation: violations found (or, under `--fix-bpa`, error-severity violations remained after auto-fix). Use `--skip-bpa` to bypass. |

## Staging Codes (`TOMIX_STAGE_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_STAGE_NOTHING_TO_COMMIT` | 1 | `stage commit` called with no staged mutations. |
| `TOMIX_STAGE_SOURCE_DRIFT` | 1 | The staged model source has changed since staging. |
| `TOMIX_STAGE_COMMIT_REMOTE_FAILED` | 1 | Failed to deploy staged changes to the remote endpoint. |
| `TOMIX_STAGE_COMMIT_LOCAL_FAILED` | 1 | Failed to apply staged changes locally. |
| `TOMIX_STAGE_MATERIALIZE_FAILED` | 1 | Failed to materialize the working copy. |
| `TOMIX_STAGE_OPTIONS_CONFLICT` | 2 | Conflicting stage options (`--revert` combined with `--save`, `--save-to`, or `--stage`). |
| `TOMIX_STAGE_SAVE_CONFLICT` | 2 | Conflicting save options (e.g. `--save` and `--stage` together). |
| `TOMIX_STAGE_NOTHING_STAGED` | 1 | `--revert` called with no staged mutation for the model. |
| `TOMIX_STAGE_MANIFEST_CORRUPT` | 2 | A staged manifest exists but no longer parses (torn write, manual edit). Run `tx stage discard` to reset staging for the model. |

## Save Codes (`TOMIX_SAVE_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_SAVE_OUTPUT_REQUIRED` | 2 | `save` called without an output path and none could be inferred. |
| `TOMIX_SAVE_OUTPUT_EXISTS` | 2 | The output path already exists (use `--force` to overwrite). |
| `TOMIX_SAVE_FIX_UNSUPPORTED` | 2 | `save --fix` is not supported by the provider. |
| `TOMIX_SAVE_UNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER` | 1 | The provider does not support model export/saving. |
| `TOMIX_SAVE_UNSUPPORTED_SERIALIZATION` | 2 | The requested serialization format is not supported. |

## Deploy Codes (`TOMIX_DEPLOY_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_DEPLOY_NO_TARGET` | 2 | `deploy` called without a target server/database. |
| `TOMIX_DEPLOY_UNSUPPORTED` | 2 | The source model cannot be deployed (wrong provider/type). |
| `TOMIX_DEPLOY_FIX_UNSUPPORTED` | 2 | `deploy --fix-bpa` was requested but the provider session does not implement `IModelMutationSession`. |
| `TOMIX_DEPLOY_FAILED` | 1 | The deployment operation failed. |

## Refresh Codes (`TOMIX_REFRESH_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_NO_REMOTE_TARGET` | 2 | `refresh` could not resolve a remote endpoint (default connection is local and no remote workspace-mode secondary is set). |
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_UNSUPPORTED` | 2 | The provider session does not implement `IModelRefreshSession` (e.g. a local TMDL/BIM model). |
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_BAD_TYPE` | 2 | `--type` was not one of `full`, `dataonly`, `automatic`, `calculate`, `clearvalues`, `defragment`, `add`. |
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_TABLE_PARTITION_CONFLICT` | 2 | `--table` and `--partition` were passed together; choose one. |
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_BAD_PARTITION` | 2 | A `--partition` value was not formatted as `TableName.PartitionName`. |
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_FAILED` | 1 | The refresh command was rejected by the server (table not found, no permissions, etc.). |

## Query Codes (`TOMIX_QUERY_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_QUERY_REQUIRED` | 2 | `query` called without `-q`, `--file`, or piped stdin. |
| `TOMIX_QUERY_INPUT_CONFLICT` | 2 | `-q` and `--file` were passed together; choose one. |
| `TOMIX_QUERY_FILE_NOT_FOUND` | 2 | The `--file` path does not exist. |
| `TOMIX_QUERY_BAD_PARAM` | 2 | A `--param` value was not formatted as `name=value`. |
| `TOMIX_QUERY_OUTPUT_FORMAT` | 2 | `-o`/`--output-file` could not resolve a json or csv format (pass `--output-format json\|csv` or use a `.json`/`.csv` extension). |
| `TOMIX_QUERY_INVALID` | 2 | The query does not start with `EVALUATE`, `DEFINE`, or `SELECT`; bypass with `--no-validate`. |
| `TOMIX_QUERY_NO_REMOTE_TARGET` | 2 | `query` could not resolve a live endpoint (default connection is local and no remote workspace-mode secondary is set). |
| `TOMIX_QUERY_UNSUPPORTED` | 2 | The provider session does not implement `IModelQuerySession` (e.g. a local TMDL/BIM model). |
| `TOMIX_QUERY_FAILED` | 1 | The query was rejected or failed on the server (DAX error, no permissions, timeout, etc.). |

The performance options are **best-effort** and do not have dedicated error codes: `--trace`,
`--plan`, and `--cold` all require admin rights on the endpoint (and are unavailable on
shared-capacity Power BI). When they cannot be honored, `tx query` prints a one-line warning to
stderr, still returns the rowset, and exits `0`.

## Incremental Refresh Codes (`TOMIX_REFRESH_POLICY_*`)

Emitted by `incremental-refresh` (show/set/rm/apply).

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_POLICY_NOT_FOUND` | 1 | `show`/`rm`/`apply` targeted a table that has no incremental refresh policy. |
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_POLICY_INVALID` | 1 | `set` produced validation errors (missing range parameters, source expression not referencing RangeStart/RangeEnd, incoherent granularity/periods, incompatible compatibility level) and `--force` was not passed. |
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_POLICY_UNSUPPORTED` | 2 | `apply` targeted a session that is not XMLA-backed (partition generation runs on the server). |
| `TOMIX_REFRESH_POLICY_APPLY_FAILED` | 1 | The server rejected the `apply` operation. |

`incremental-refresh` also reuses `TOMIX_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` (table missing), `TOMIX_REFRESH_NO_REMOTE_TARGET` (`apply` with no remote endpoint), `TOMIX_NO_PROVIDER`, `TOMIX_AUTH_REQUIRED`, and the `TOMIX_MUTATION_*` / `TOMIX_STAGE_*` families via the shared mutation runner. Validation findings surfaced in the result payload (e.g. `range_parameter_missing`, `granularity_order`, `no_polling_expression`) are lowercase snake tokens, not `TOMIX_` diagnostic codes.

## VertiPaq Codes (`TOMIX_VERTIPAQ_*` / `TOMIX_VPAX_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_VERTIPAQ_UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | 2 | The source is a local model definition (TMDL/BIM) with no live storage engine; connect to a deployed model or use `--import`. |
| `TOMIX_VERTIPAQ_OPTIONS_CONFLICT` | 2 | Conflicting options: `--import` with `--export` or `--annotate`, `--obfuscate` without `--export`, or `--save` without `--annotate`. |
| `TOMIX_VERTIPAQ_INVALID_FIELDS` | 2 | An unknown `--fields` token for the selected view, or `--fields` used with multiple views. |
| `TOMIX_VERTIPAQ_INVALID_TOP` | 2 | `--top` was not a positive integer. |
| `TOMIX_VERTIPAQ_TABLE_NOT_FOUND` | 1 | The positional table filter matched no table in the statistics. |
| `TOMIX_VERTIPAQ_FAILED` | 1 | Statistics extraction against the live engine failed. |
| `TOMIX_VPAX_READ_FAILED` | 2 | The `--import` file is missing, unreadable, or not a valid statistics package. |
| `TOMIX_VPAX_WRITE_FAILED` | 2 | The `--export` target (or its obfuscation dictionary) could not be written. |

## Init Codes (`TOMIX_INIT_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_INIT_OUTPUT_REQUIRED` | 2 | `init` called without an output path. |
| `TOMIX_INIT_OUTPUT_EXISTS` | 2 | The output path already exists. |
| `TOMIX_INIT_UNSUPPORTED_SERIALIZATION` | 2 | The requested serialization format is not supported for `init`. |
| `TOMIX_INIT_UNSUPPORTED_COMPATIBILITY_MODE` | 2 | The requested compatibility level is not supported. |

## Auth Codes (`TOMIX_AUTH_*`)

> **Note:** Codes in this section are diagnostic codes, not environment variables.
> See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for auth-related env vars.

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_AUTH_FAILED` | 1 | Authentication failed (invalid credentials, token expired, etc.). |
| `TOMIX_AUTH_REQUIRED` | 1 | Authentication is required but no credentials were provided. |
| `TOMIX_AUTH_SECRET_REQUIRED` | 2 | A service-principal login needs a secret and none was provided via `--password -` (stdin), `--password-file`, or the interactive prompt. |
| `TOMIX_AUTH_SECRET_SOURCE_CONFLICT` | 2 | `--password -` and `--password-file` (or the certificate-password equivalents) were combined; choose one. |
| `TOMIX_AUTH_SECRET_FILE_NOT_FOUND` | 2 | The `--password-file` / `--certificate-password-file` path does not exist or is empty. |

## Script Codes (`TOMIX_SCRIPT_*`)

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_SCRIPT_FILE_NOT_FOUND` | 1 | The script file was not found. |
| `TOMIX_SCRIPT_REQUIRED` | 2 | `script` called without a script file or inline script. |

## Config Codes (`TOMIX_CONFIG_*`)

> **Note:** `TOMIX_CONFIG_DIR` is an environment variable, not a diagnostic code. See below.

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_CONFIG_INVALID_VALUE` | 2 | `config set` called with an invalid value. |
| `TOMIX_CONFIG_UNKNOWN_KEY` | 2 | `config set` called with an unknown configuration key. |

## Profile Codes

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND` | 1 | The named profile was not found. |
| `TOMIX_PROFILE_NAME_REQUIRED` | 2 | `profile set` called without a profile name. |

## Validate Issue Codes

Codes carried on the issues inside a `validate` result (not top-level diagnostics; the
command exits `1` when any error-severity issue is present). `DAX*` codes come from the
offline DAX reference scan; `TOMIX_*` codes come from structural integrity checks.

| Code | Severity | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| `DAX0001` | Error | A DAX expression references a table that does not exist in the model. |
| `DAX0002` | Error | A DAX expression references a column that does not exist on the named table (and no measure by that name exists). |
| `DAX0003` | Warning | An unqualified `[X]` reference resolves to no measure or column anywhere in the model. Warning-severity because it may be a query-scoped extension column (`ADDCOLUMNS`/`SUMMARIZE`), which offline analysis cannot see. |
| `TOMIX_BROKEN_RELATIONSHIP` | Error | A relationship endpoint refers to a missing column. |
| `TOMIX_BROKEN_SORT_BY` | Error | A column's sort-by column does not exist on its table. |
| `TOMIX_BROKEN_LEVEL` | Error | A hierarchy level is bound to a column that does not exist on its table. |
| `TOMIX_MODEL_LOAD_FAILED` | Error | The model could not be opened or snapshotted at all (e.g. TMDL with unresolvable references); the provider's message is passed through. |

## General Codes

| Code | Exit | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `TOMIX_NO_PROVIDER` | 2 | No registered provider can open the model. |
| `TOMIX_MODEL_LOAD_FAILED` | 2 | A provider matched the model but its source could not be loaded (unparsable TMDL/BIM, unresolvable references, unreadable file). The provider's message describes what failed; the command never ran. |
| `TOMIX_NO_MODEL` | 2 | No model reference was provided and none could be inferred. |
| `TOMIX_CONNECT_FAILED` | 1 | `connect` failed to establish a session. |
| `TOMIX_CONNECT_INVALID_TARGET` | 1 | `connect` was given a server that is neither a remote endpoint nor a local model path. |
| `TOMIX_INTERACTIVE_REQUIRED` | 1 | An interactive-only flow (`connect --remote`, a valueless `-w`) was invoked without a TTY (e.g. `--non-interactive`, `--quiet`, redirected input, or json/csv output). Pass the workspace/model explicitly. |
| `TOMIX_REMOTE_LIST_FAILED` | 1 | Listing workspaces or models failed (Power BI REST or XMLA error) during an interactive `connect`. |
| `TOMIX_DATABASE_NOT_FOUND` | 1 | The database/model name was not found on the server. |
| `TOMIX_DEPS_PATH_REQUIRED` | 2 | `deps` called without an object path. |
| `TOMIX_FIND_INVALID_REGEX` | 2 | `find --regex` called with an invalid regular expression pattern. |
| `TOMIX_UNKNOWN_OPTION` | 2 | An unrecognized `--option` would have been bound to a positional argument (e.g. a typo'd flag). Put `--` before positional values that must start with `-`. |
| `TOMIX_MOVE_UNSUPPORTED` | 1 | `mv` called for an unsupported object type or operation (e.g. moving between parents). |
| `TOMIX_MOVE_INVALID_PATH` | 2 | `mv` source or destination is missing an object name (empty path, trailing `/`). |
| `TOMIX_MOVE_NOOP` | 1 | `mv` source and destination are identical; nothing to rename. |
| `TOMIX_REPLACE_PATTERN_REQUIRED` | 2 | `replace` called without a search pattern. |
| `TOMIX_SET_PROPERTY_REQUIRED` | 2 | `set` called without a property to set. |
| `TOMIX_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED_LANGUAGE` | 2 | `format` called with an unsupported expression language. |
| `TOMIX_COMPLETION_UNSUPPORTED_SHELL` | 2 | `completion` called with an unsupported shell name. |
| `TOMIX_INVALID_OUTPUT_FORMAT` | 2 | `--output-format` value is not one of: auto, text, json, csv, tmsl, bim, tmdl. |
| `TOMIX_OUTPUT_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED` | 2 | The command cannot render the requested `--output-format`; the message lists the formats it supports. |
| `TOMIX_UNEXPECTED` | 1 | An unexpected exception reached the top-level handler. The stack trace is only printed under `--debug`; with `--error-format json` it is embedded as a `detail` field in the envelope so stderr stays valid JSON. |

## Environment Variables

The following `TOMIX_*` tokens are **environment variables**, not diagnostic codes:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TOMIX_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Azure AD client id for service principal auth. |
| `TOMIX_AUTH_TENANT` | Azure AD tenant id for service principal auth. |
| `TOMIX_SESSION` | Session id for persisting the active model connection. |
| `TOMIX_CONFIG_DIR` | Custom path to the configuration directory. |
| `TOMIX_POWERQUERY_FORMATTER_API` | Custom Power Query Formatter API endpoint URL. |

## Migration: Unified Mutation Error Codes

The following error codes were replaced by unified `TOMIX_MUTATION_*` codes.
Scripts that pattern-match on the old codes should update to the new ones.

| Old code | New code |
|----------|----------|
| `TOMIX_REPLACE_INVALID_ARGUMENT` | `TOMIX_MUTATION_INVALID_VALUE` |
| `TOMIX_REPLACE_UNSUPPORTED` | `TOMIX_MUTATION_UNSUPPORTED` |
| `TOMIX_REPLACE_FAILED` | `TOMIX_MUTATION_FAILED` |
| `TOMIX_REPLACE_SAVE_FAILED` | `TOMIX_MUTATION_SAVE_FAILED` |
| `TOMIX_SCRIPT_SAVE_UNSUPPORTED` | `TOMIX_MUTATION_UNSUPPORTED` |
| `TOMIX_SCRIPT_SAVE_FAILED` | `TOMIX_MUTATION_SAVE_FAILED` |
| `TOMIX_BPA_FIX_UNSUPPORTED` | `TOMIX_MUTATION_UNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER` |
| `TOMIX_BPA_IGNORE_UNSUPPORTED` | `TOMIX_MUTATION_UNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER` |

### What did not change

Command-specific validation codes (checked before entering `MutationRunner`) are unchanged:

- `TOMIX_REPLACE_PATTERN_REQUIRED`
- `TOMIX_SET_PROPERTY_REQUIRED`
- `TOMIX_SCRIPT_FILE_NOT_FOUND`
- `TOMIX_SCRIPT_REQUIRED`
- `TOMIX_BPA_RULE_ID_REQUIRED`
- `TOMIX_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED_LANGUAGE`
