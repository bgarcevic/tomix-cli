# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

See [docs/cli-ux-guidelines.md](docs/cli-ux-guidelines.md) for the versioning policy
and the API surface that major versions protect.

## [Unreleased]

- Remote model support: `connect`, mutate (`add`/`set`/`rm`/`mv`/`replace`), `deploy` over XMLA.
- BPA engine rewritten with Dynamic-LINQ (70 bundled rules), structured diagnostics, ignore/disable, external rule collections.
- Project renamed `mdl-cli` → `tomix-cli` (`tx` command); MinVer-based versioning and CI automation added.

### Added

- `tx vertipaq` — VertiPaq storage statistics for deployed models, built on the MIT-licensed
  sql-bi VertiPaq-Analyzer libraries. Views: columns by size (default), `--tables`, `--columns`,
  `--relationships`, `--partitions`, `--all`; `--stats` model summary; `--detail` size breakdown;
  `--fields <list>` per-view field selection (with a relative-size `bar`); `--top <N>`.
  A positional table name filters to one table. `--export <file.vpax>` / `--import <file.vpax>`
  for offline analysis, `--obfuscate` (writes a private `.dict` dictionary). `--annotate` writes
  `Vertipaq_*` annotations onto the model/tables/columns via the mutation lifecycle (`--save` to
  persist, workspace mirroring included). In workspace sessions with a local primary, statistics
  are read from the remote side automatically. JSON (stable contract) and single-view CSV output.
  New `TOMIX_VERTIPAQ_*` / `TOMIX_VPAX_*` diagnostic codes.
- `tx set -q name` and `tx mv` warn when a rename leaves DAX expressions referencing the old name, listing the referencing objects (renames never rewrite dependent DAX, so the breakage was previously silent until a deploy). JSON output gains an optional `brokenReferences` field. New `--strict-refs` flag fails the rename instead (`TOMIX_RENAME_BREAKS_REFS`, exit 1) so CI can gate on it.
- `tx refresh` — triggers data refresh on deployed models via XMLA. Supports `--type`, `--table`, `--partition`, `--apply-refresh-policy`/`--skip-refresh-policy`, `--effective-date`, `--max-parallelism`, `--dry-run`, `--no-progress`, `--trace`. Live per-table progress from XMLA `SessionTrace` with summary table (`Rows`, `Query`, `Read`, `Total`, `Rows/s`). JSON/CSV output support.
- `TOMIX_REFRESH_*` diagnostic codes.
- `Styling.Number(long)` and `Styling.DurationSeconds(double)` helpers.
- `tx add` infers the object type from path keywords (`tables/Sales/measures/Revenue`), making `-t` optional for the common forms. Matches the convention used by `ls`/`get`.
- `OutputExistsException` and `TOMIX_SAVE_OUTPUT_EXISTS` error code for save-target conflicts.
- `tx add` creates relationships: `tx add "Sales[Key]->Product[Key]"` (many side -> one side), with optional `-t Relationship` or a `relationships/` path prefix. Properties like `isActive` and `crossFilteringBehavior` apply via `-q`/`-i`.
- `tx add -t PolicyRangePartition` accepts `--range-start`, `--range-end` (yyyy-MM-dd, both required) and `--range-granularity` (Day/Month/Quarter/Year) instead of a hardcoded 2020–2021 range.
- `tx add --source-schema` sets the schema on an EntityPartition (previously mis-mapped from `--source-database`).
- `tx add -t` accepts long-form type aliases: `CalculatedTable`, `CalculatedColumn`, `CalculationGroup`, `CalculationItem`, `CalculatedMeasure`.
- `tx set` reaches previously unaddressable object types: relationships (endpoint path `Sales[Key]->Product[Key]` or GUID name), named expressions, functions, calculation items, cultures, perspectives, data sources, hierarchy levels (`Table/Hierarchy/Level`), and role members. Their property handlers existed but no path could resolve them.
- `tx set`/`tx rm` accept container-keyword paths (`tables/Sales/measures/Revenue`, `tables/T/partitions/P`), matching `add`/`ls`/`get`.
- `--type` accepts `level`, `calculationitem`/`calcitem`, `member`/`rolemember`, and `datasource`.
- `tx add` path-keyword inference extended to `calcgroups/`, `calcitems/`, `expressions/`, `functions/`, `calendars/`, and `kpis/`. (`datasources/` still requires `-t` — Provider vs Structured is ambiguous.)
- `TOMIX_ADD_OPTION_UNSUPPORTED` error code: an `add` option supplied for an object type that cannot consume it now hard-errors instead of being silently ignored.
- `tx replace --in annotations` now works: replaces annotation values across the model, tables, columns, measures, hierarchies, partitions, and roles. Explicit-only — `--in all` deliberately does not touch annotations (values are often tool-generated JSON).
- `TOMIX_UNKNOWN_OPTION` error code (exit 2): an unrecognized `--option` that would have been silently bound to a positional argument (e.g. `tx ls --bogusflag`) now hard-errors with a did-you-mean suggestion. Put `--` before positional values that must start with `-`.
- `tx find --in formatStrings`, `--in displayFolders`, and `--in annotations` now actually search (they previously parsed but matched nothing). `formatStrings`/`displayFolders` are included in the default `all` scope; annotations are searched only when requested explicitly (models carry hundreds of machine-generated `PBI_*` annotations). `--in` values are validated at parse time.
- Selector quoting supports apostrophes in object names: a bare apostrophe is now an ordinary character (`tx ls "Høreprøver KPI'er"` just works), and inside a quoted segment `''` is a literal apostrophe (`'Høreprøver KPI''er'`). A quote only opens a group at the start of a segment.
- `tx deps` tracks quoted bare-table references: `COUNTROWS('Udlån')` now reports the table as upstream. Unquoted bare table names remain untracked (indistinguishable from `VAR` names without a DAX parser).
- `tx ls --output-format json` objects now include a `path` field, so same-named measures/columns in different tables are distinguishable.

### Changed (breaking)

- A failed workspace sync now exits 1 instead of 0. Mutation commands with `--save` (and `tx save`) still perform the local save and render the result — including the `syncWarning` in JSON — but the exit code flags that the mirror was left behind the source, so CI can catch the drift. Use `--no-sync` to intentionally skip the mirror (exit 0).
- Global `--quiet` no longer has a `-q` alias: `-q` was silently shadowed by the local property/query option on `add`/`set`/`get`/`bpa`. Use `--quiet`.
- `tx add --revert` combined with `--save-to` now errors (`TOMIX_STAGE_OPTIONS_CONFLICT`, exit 2) instead of silently dropping the save target. Applies to all mutation commands.
- `tx add` options supplied to a type that ignores them (`--columns` on CalcTable/CalcGroup, `--partition-expression` on Entity/PolicyRange partitions, `--connection-string`/`--source` on StructuredDataSource, etc.) now fail with `TOMIX_ADD_OPTION_UNSUPPORTED` (exit 1) instead of exit 0 with the option discarded.
- `tx add --source-database` no longer applies to EntityPartition; use `--source-schema` for the schema name.
- `tx add -t PolicyRangePartition` requires `--range-start` and `--range-end`.
- Invalid `--mode`, `--serialization`, and `--range-granularity` values on `tx add` are rejected at parse time (before any model is opened) instead of at apply time. `--serialization` accepts `tmdl`, `bim`, `tmsl`, `auto` (the previously advertised `te-folder`/`pbip` were never implemented).
- A dangling `-q` with no matching `-i` on `tx add` is now a usage error (exit 2) instead of being silently dropped.
- Exit codes aligned with the documented contract: `TOMIX_NO_PROVIDER`, `TOMIX_NO_MODEL`, and `TOMIX_DEPLOY_NO_TARGET` exit 2 (previously 1), and command-line parse errors (unknown option, missing argument, invalid option value) exit 2 (previously System.CommandLine's default of 1).
- Output formats a command cannot render are rejected with exit 2 (`'tx find' does not support --output-format csv. Supported: text, json.`) instead of silently falling back to text. Now enforced by every command: `ls`/`refresh`/`save`/`script` support text/json/csv, `get` supports all formats (text/json/csv/tmdl/bim/tmsl), and the rest support text/json. `--output-format csv` on `diff`/`validate` previously produced their text rendering minus a banner line, not CSV — it is now rejected too.
- `tx deps --max-depth` must be at least 1; `0` previously acted as unlimited.
- Invalid `--regex` patterns on `tx find` fail up-front with `TOMIX_FIND_INVALID_REGEX` (exit 2) instead of crashing mid-search.
- `tx add --revert` prints `Reverted.` and an `--if-not-exists` no-op prints `Already exists: <path>` instead of the misleading `Added: False` + "Changes not saved" warning. JSON output gains optional `reverted`/`existingPath` fields.
- Mutation spinners now label the actual operation (`Working...`/`Staging...`/`Reverting...`) instead of always `Saving...`.
- `tx replace --in <unknown-scope>` now errors (`TOMIX_MUTATION_INVALID_VALUE`) instead of exiting 0 with nothing replaced.
- `tx mv --revert` prints `Reverted.` instead of falsely claiming `Renamed: A -> B`; `tx rm --revert` prints `Reverted.` and `rm --if-exists` on a missing object prints `Not found: <path> (nothing removed)` instead of exiting silently. JSON output gains an optional `reverted` field on both.
- Invalid `--serialization` values on `set`/`mv`/`rm`/`replace`/`save`/`init`/`script`/`bpa` are rejected at parse time, matching `add`. Help text no longer advertises the unimplemented `te-folder`/`pbip`/`database.json` formats (`init` genuinely supports `pbip`).

### Changed

- `refresh` promoted from compatibility stub to real command.
- `TomServerModelSession` implements `IModelRefreshSession`.
- `tx add`/`set`/`rm`/`mv` help examples now use the canonical keyword-path form (`tables/Sales/measures/Revenue`) so they are copy-pasteable.
- `--save` to the source model (in-place) no longer errors with "Output directory already exists". In-place saves overwrite cleanly; `--save-to <existing>` still errors unless `--force` (now mapped to `TOMIX_SAVE_OUTPUT_EXISTS`).

### Fixed

- In-place `--save` against a remote model (`powerbi://`/`asazure://`) actually persists now.
  The remote session saved via parameterless `Database.Update()`, which alters only the database
  object itself — model-tree changes (measures, properties, annotations) were silently dropped
  while the command reported "Saved" (verified live: an annotation write survived a fresh
  connection only after the fix). Remote saves now use `Model.SaveChanges()` and surface XMLA
  errors returned in its result instead of assuming success. Affected every mutation command
  (`set`, `mv`, `rm`, `replace`, `vertipaq --annotate`) when connected directly to a workspace;
  workspace-mirror sync (deploy-based) was not affected.
- `--help` exits 0 on every command. Commands with required positional arguments (`mv`, `add`, `rm`, `set`, `get`, `find`, ...) printed help but exited 2, because the missing arguments still counted as a usage error — breaking `tx <cmd> --help && ...` scripting. The Spectre help action now clears parse errors the way the built-in one does; genuinely missing arguments (without `--help`) still exit 2.
- Workspace sync with no cached login no longer stalls silently for minutes before warning (observed: 4m37s). Token acquisition now gates on the recorded login state and fails immediately with "Not authenticated. Run 'tx auth login'." — without opening the OS-keystore-backed MSAL cache, whose authorization prompt can block a non-interactive process — and silent acquisition is capped at 30s with an actionable timeout error as a backstop.
- The live spinner now shows `Syncing to <workspace>...` during the workspace-sync phase instead of sitting on `Saving...`, and the sync-failure warning explains how to recover (re-push with `tx save`, or skip with `--no-sync`).
- `tx mv` destinations are parsed with the same quote- and DAX-aware rules as sources. A DAX-form destination (`'Sales'[New]`) previously became the *literal* object name — `mv "Sales[a]" "Sales[b]" --save` persisted a column named `Sales[b]` that mv could no longer address — and apostrophes in destination names were silently stripped (`QA's Measure` → `QAs Measure`). Result paths also keep their apostrophes now.
- `tx mv` with a missing object name (empty source/destination, trailing `/`) errors with `TOMIX_MOVE_INVALID_PATH` (exit 2) instead of the misleading "Moving objects between parents is not supported yet." Identical source and destination error with `TOMIX_MOVE_NOOP` instead of reporting a rename that never happened — previously this also emitted a false broken-references warning. Case-only renames proceed but skip the broken-references warning (DAX resolves names case-insensitively).
- Mutation saves can no longer silently change serialization in place: `mv/set/add/rm --save --serialization bim` on a TMDL model wrote a stray `definition.bim` inside the PBIP folder, left the real model untouched, and reported "Saved" — now a hard error directing to `--save-to`.
- `--revert` with nothing staged fails with `TOMIX_STAGE_NOTHING_STAGED` instead of printing `Reverted.` (exit 0) unconditionally.
- `--save-to` no longer deploys the mutation to the connected workspace mirror: it writes a copy to a side location while the connected source is untouched, so syncing the mirror silently diverged it from the source.
- `tx mv --stage` output now says `Staged. Run 'tx stage commit' to promote.` — it previously claimed "Changes not saved. Use --save to persist", steering users into bypassing the stage.
- `--error-format json` is honored by `mv`/`set`/`add`/`rm` (previously only discover commands forwarded it; mutation errors always printed as text).
- `tx mv` rejects `--output-format csv`/`tmdl` (exit 2) instead of silently rendering text; `--force` help text now matches what it does (gates `--save-to` overwrite).
- `tx add` rejects cross-kind name collisions within a table: measures, columns, and hierarchies share a namespace in tabular models, but `add tables/T/measures/X` succeeded when a column (or hierarchy) named `X` already existed — writing TMDL the engine rejects at deploy. All three collections are checked and the error names the colliding kind. `--if-not-exists` still tolerates a same-kind duplicate; a cross-kind squatter remains a hard error.
- TMDL saves no longer rewrite every table file of a Power BI Desktop-authored model. `TmdlSerializer` indents M partition `source =` bodies two levels below the property while Desktop writes them one level deep (they agree on measures, calc items, and DAX/calculated partition sources), so any `--save` re-indented every M partition in the folder. The exporter now post-processes M-partition source blocks to Desktop's depth — a save of an untouched Desktop model is byte-identical, and a mutation diffs only the lines it changed. The transform is lossless (TMDL strips common leading whitespace of delimited expressions on parse) and idempotent.
- `tx set`/`tx rm` DAX bracket paths (`'Table'[Child]`) resolve only to measures and columns, like DAX itself. Previously a same-named partition could be silently picked — `set 'T'[X] -q expression` would replace the partition's M source query instead of the measure's DAX.
- `tx set`/`tx rm` mutation paths with embedded apostrophes now resolve, in both `'Månedens KPI''er'` (escaped) and raw `Månedens KPI'er` forms, matching the `ls`/`get` selector rules.
- Same-name collisions across object kinds (e.g. a measure and a partition both named `Budget`) now fail with `TOMIX_OBJECT_AMBIGUOUS` and a `--type` hint instead of silently mutating whichever kind resolved first.
- `tx set`/`tx rm` not-found errors now emit `TOMIX_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` with a hint (previously generic `TOMIX_MUTATION_FAILED`); unsupported-property errors name the object type that actually resolved.
- `tx set --revert` combined with `-q`/`-i` hard-errors (`TOMIX_STAGE_OPTIONS_CONFLICT`, exit 2) instead of silently discarding the assignment.
- `tx set --force` help text no longer promises validation-error handling that does not exist; it gates `--save-to` overwrite.
- Values read from stdin (`-i -` or piped) no longer keep the trailing newline that `echo`/heredoc pipes append.
- `--save` on an existing model directory no longer fails; the directory is cleared and rewritten so deleted objects don't leave orphan files.
- Empty `--type` on `tx add` now produces an actionable error ("No object type given…") instead of `Adding object type '' is not supported yet.`
- `tx ls` honors `--error-format json` (it previously always printed the text error while `get`/`find`/`deps` emitted the JSON envelope).
- `tx deps --quiet` no longer prints "Running semantic analysis...".
- `TOMIX_OBJECT_AMBIGUOUS` errors (`get`, `deps`) list up to 5 candidate paths with their kinds and hint `-t <type>` disambiguation, instead of only naming the ambiguous path.
- Help fixes: the `get`/`find`/`deps` examples no longer show nonexistent flags (`-t dax`, `find --type`, `deps --direction`); the `find` zero-match hint no longer suggests a nonexistent option; `ls --type` help lists `calculatedcolumn`; the `--output-format` description typo "tTomix" is `tmdl` again.

### Added

- `tx refresh` triggers a data refresh on a deployed model with Tabular Editor-compatible flags
  (`--type`, `--table`, `--partition`, `--apply-refresh-policy` / `--skip-refresh-policy`,
  `--effective-date`, `--max-parallelism`, `--dry-run`, `--no-progress`, `--trace`). Targets the
  active remote connection by default, or the remote workspace-mode secondary when the default is
  local. Live per-table row counts during refresh are streamed from the XMLA `SessionTrace` into a
  Spectre `Live` table, and a final summary table reports per-table `Rows`, `Query`, `Read`, `Total`,
  and `Rows/s` plus a roll-up. `--output-format json|csv` machine output is supported.
- New `TOMIX_REFRESH_*` diagnostic codes (`TOMIX_REFRESH_NO_REMOTE_TARGET`, `TOMIX_REFRESH_UNSUPPORTED`,
  `TOMIX_REFRESH_BAD_TYPE`, `TOMIX_REFRESH_TABLE_PARTITION_CONFLICT`, `TOMIX_REFRESH_BAD_PARTITION`,
  `TOMIX_REFRESH_FAILED`).
- `Styling.Number(long)` and `Styling.DurationSeconds(double)` helpers for human-only output.

### Changed

- `refresh` promoted from a compatibility stub to a real command.
- `TomServerModelSession` now implements `IModelRefreshSession`; refresh is only supported on
  sessions connected to a live XMLA endpoint.

### Removed

- `tx macro` command and everything around it: the `TOMIX_MACRO_*` error codes, the `TOMIX_MACROS_PATH`/`TE_MACROS_PATH` environment variables, and the `macros` config key. `macro run` was never implemented, so the catalog could be edited but never executed; `tx script` covers running C# against a model.
- `tx info` command (use `tx load` or `tx connect` instead).

### Fixed

- `connect` accepts documented bare workspace names (e.g. `tx connect MyWorkspace Sales`) instead of rejecting them with `TOMIX_CONNECT_INVALID_TARGET`; the name is normalized to a fully-qualified `powerbi://` endpoint so every later command can open it.
- `refresh --partition` malformed values are routed through `ErrorOutput` as `TOMIX_REFRESH_BAD_PARTITION`, honoring `--error-format json` instead of writing raw text to stderr.
- `refresh` per-table `Query`/`Read`/`Total` accuracy — trace sink now maps `ExecuteSql` → Query, `ReadData` → Read + row count instead of wrong subclasses.
- `refresh` row counts captured in-flight via `ReadData.IntegerData`; removed broken post-refresh DMV query.
- `refresh --trace` bare flag now resolves to stderr as documented, instead of silently doing nothing.
- `connect --workspace` no longer drops primary connection when overwrite prompt is declined; exits 0 instead of 1.
- `connect --workspace` shows spinner during remote probe (no silent gap).
- `connect` rejects invalid targets (e.g. typos) with `TOMIX_CONNECT_INVALID_TARGET`.
- `--save-to` on mutation commands honors `--force` (no silent overwrite).
- Source resolution honors global `--server`/`--database` on `ls`, `get`, `find`, etc.
- `deploy --fix-bpa` blocks on remaining error-severity violations; unsupported sessions fail with `TOMIX_DEPLOY_FIX_UNSUPPORTED`.
- `refresh --trace` no longer disposes `Console.Error` — wrapped in `NonDisposingTextWriter`.
- `refresh` honors injected connection session in `ActiveModelResolver` (resolution + tests no longer require live remote session).
